# BusPassManagementSystem
The Bus Pass Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of obtaining bus passes. It provides a convenient platform for both users and administrators to manage bus pass requests efficiently. The Bus Pass Management System is developed utilizing a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL technologies to create a robust and user-friendly web application. HTML forms the backbone for structuring the web pages, while CSS is employed to style elements and ensure a visually appealing interface. JavaScript adds interactivity, enhances user experience, and validates inputs on the client side. On the server side, PHP handles backend logic, processes user requests, and interacts with the MySQL database to store and manage data related to user accounts, bus pass applications, and payment details.
